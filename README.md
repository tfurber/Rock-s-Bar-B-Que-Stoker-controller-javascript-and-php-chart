# Rock-s-Bar-B-Que-Stoker-controller-javascript-and-php-chart



2021-11-25 - Revision 0.1 


I made this little script to help cook the Thanksgiving turducken.  The other available app online you can find that people say works on a stoker is an .exe file, which is pretty dangerous to simply download and run.

I'm running this on a raspberry pie running Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).   It should require ntp and php only.

The scripts may need a little tweaking to make them work for you.

You may have to adjust the 0 and 1 values depending on the position of your meat and dome probes.
